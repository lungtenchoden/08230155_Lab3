    <div class="project fade-in">
      <h3>Physics Project: Working with Bipolar Junction Transistors</h3>
      <img src="bjt.jpg" alt="Picture of working BJT" class="project-img">
      <p>As part of a group activity in our Physics class, we worked on an experiment to understand how a bipolar junction transistor (BJT) functions,
        specifically using the BC547. We set up a biasing circuit on a breadboard and tested how the
        transistor responded to different voltages, observing its behavior in modes like active and saturation.
        Through this hands-on process, we learned how transistors manage current flow and why proper biasing is key.
        It was a great opportunity to explore electronics practically and deepen our understanding of how these tiny components play a big role in everyday devices.

    <!-- Project 2 -->
    <div class="project fade-in">
      <h3>DDD Project: Mini Project on Database Design</h3>
      <img src="erd.jpg" alt="Image of Sports Event Management System" class="project-img">
      <p>As a team, we worked on building a Sports Event Management System for the Bhutan University Sports Federation (BUSF), designed to make organizing
        inter-college sports events smoother and more efficient. We focused on features like event registration, 
        scheduling, team and participant management, and result tracking. Throughout the project, we learned 
        how to turn real-world challenges into practical solutions using technology.
        It was a great experience that helped us grow our skills in system design, collaboration, and applying digital tools to improve coordination across multiple colleges.

    <!-- Project 3 -->
    <div class="project fade-in">
      <h3>Future Project: Gym Management System</h3>
      <img src="gym.png" alt="Prototype" class="project-img">
      <p>We are planning to develop a digital platform for the Samtse College of Education (SCE) gym that will allow students and staff to register online, 
        track their attendance, and manage membership payments. The system will also include features for monitoring equipment usage, scheduling workout sessions, and providing important gym-related updates. 
        By digitizing these services, the platform aims to reduce manual paperwork, improve record accuracy, and save time for both users and gym staff. 
        Ultimately, the Gym Management System will ensure a more efficient, transparent, and user-friendly experience for the entire SCE community.
